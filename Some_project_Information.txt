Subject -:Assignment 2

Here first, I have created a form where user have to fill the data and submit that data to the admin defined in the assignment
to create that form i have used Bootstrap and jQuery library to perform the functionality. Here I, had given access to API 
calls which I have decleared in the server file.I have called these methods through ajax. Talking about server side file
Here I, have attached express library,mongoClient,and to remove cors issues have installed these librarires in the same folder
Firstly I have called "getcustomers" method to check weather user data is able to submit to the backend or not.
Then I, have given "POST" method call to submit the data to the database.
Now according to the assignment description that data should get submit to the "test@aplswd.com" so have used "nodemailer"
library to send the data to the resective email.
